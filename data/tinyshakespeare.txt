First Citizen:
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.

All:
Speak, speak.

First Citizen:
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?

All:
Resolved. resolved.

First Citizen:
First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.

All:
We know't, we know't.

First Citizen:
Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
Is't a verdict?

All:
No more talking on't; let it be done. Away, away!

Second Citizen:
One word, good citizens.

First Citizen:
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;
but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
inventory to particularise their abundance; our
sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.

Second Citizen:
Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?

All:
Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.

Second Citizen:
Consider you what services he has done for his country?

First Citizen:
Very well; and could be content to give him good
report for't, but that he pays himself with being proud.

Second Citizen:
Nay, but speak not maliciously.

First Citizen:
I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
content to say it was for his country he did it, I say
'twas for himself; and that he wore his arrogance
like a suit of armour, which kept off the blows of
the people's malice, and the many bullets of the law.
But our pikes are not for the law's defence, nor for
the war's armour, but for the flesh and blood of our
own bodies.

All:
We'll have corn at our own price. Let us execute
Caius Marcius.

Second Citizen:
Nay, let's not break into him; for he is worthy
of double worship, if he be worthy of one.

First Citizen:
We have ever your good word.

Second Citizen:
He's not a man of words, but of deeds.

All:
Mark you that!

First Citizen:
He's a lion that I am proud to hunt.

All:
He's a very lion, and we are the men.

Second Citizen:
Therefore, let him alone till some other time.

First Citizen:
Marry, when? At the next rising of the sun?

Second Citizen:
Nay, before that.

First Citizen:
Why, then, to-morrow.

Second Citizen:
To-morrow! I'll have it tonight.

First Citizen:
Come, come, we'll have him.

Second Citizen:
Hold, hold; I say, hold.

First Citizen:
Why, what's the matter?

Second Citizen:
Matter! Why, he's a noble man.

First Citizen:
A noble man! A very noble man.

Second Citizen:
Nay, but he's a very dog to the commonalty.

First Citizen:
He's a very dog, and a very noble man.

Second Citizen:
Therefore, let him alone.

All:
No, no, no, no!

First Citizen:
Then follow me, and I'll bring him to his knees.

All:
Follow, follow!

Second Citizen:
Stay, stay, stay!

First Citizen:
Why, what's the matter now?

Second Citizen:
Matter! Why, he's a noble man.

First Citizen:
A noble man! A very noble man.

Second Citizen:
Nay, but he's a very dog to the commonalty.

First Citizen:
He's a very dog, and a very noble man.

Second Citizen:
Therefore, let him alone.

All:
No, no, no, no!
